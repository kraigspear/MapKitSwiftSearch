## Key Design Principles

### 1. Information Hiding
- Private properties expose only essential functionality
- Complex implementation details are encapsulated
- Clear boundaries between public API and internal logic

### 2. Structured Concurrency
- Async/await throughout instead of callback-based patterns
- Proper Task management with automatic cancellation
- MainActor isolation for thread safety

### 3. Sendable Compliance
- All public data types are thread-safe value types
- Safe passage between concurrent contexts
- Future-proof for strict concurrency requirements

### 4. Platform Abstraction
- Core functionality is platform-independent
- Platform-specific features in separate extensions
- Clean separation of concerns

### 5. Error Handling
- Specific error types for different failure modes
- Graceful degradation and recovery patterns
- Clear error propagation and handling guidance

## Recent Major Improvements

### Completer Continuation Fix (June 2025)
- **Problem**: Shared MKLocalSearchCompleter caused race conditions
- **Solution**: Fresh completer instances per search operation
- **Benefit**: Complete isolation and thread safety

### Strict Concurrency (August 2025)
- **Change**: Enabled StrictConcurrency experimental feature
- **Benefit**: Compile-time detection of concurrency issues
- **Impact**: Validated existing Sendable conformance

### Highlight Range Bug Fix
- **Problem**: Wrong highlight range used in subtitle highlighting
- **Solution**: Corrected range usage with test coverage
- **Prevention**: Source code verification tests added

## Architecture Highlights

### Fresh Completer Per Search
```swift
// Why: Prevents delegate callback conflicts
let searchCompleter = MKLocalSearchCompleter()
let handler = LocalSearchCompleterHandler()
searchCompleter.delegate = handler
```

### Task-Based Cancellation
```swift
// Why: Clean cancellation semantics
return try await withTaskCancellationHandler {
    // Search logic
} onCancel: {
    searchCompleter.cancel()
}
```

### Private Range Properties
```swift
// Why: Information hiding and API stability
public struct HighlightRange {
    private let location: Int
    private let length: Int
    
    func toAttributedStringRange(in attributedString: AttributedString) -> Range<AttributedString.Index>?
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Read** [Getting Started Guide](Guides/GettingStarted.md) for basic usage
2. **Review** [Architecture Overview](Architecture.md) for design understanding
3. **Explore** [Component Documentation](Components/) for detailed API reference
4. **Study** [Sequence Diagrams](Diagrams/SearchFlowSequence.md) for flow understanding
5. **Check** [Advanced Usage](Guides/AdvancedUsage.md) for complex scenarios

## Contributing Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase:

1. **Understand the Why**: Read the relevant internal documentation to understand design decisions
2. **Maintain Principles**: Follow the established patterns for concurrency, error handling, and information hiding
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure both code comments and markdown documentation reflect changes
4. **Add Tests**: Include regression tests for bug fixes and appropriate coverage for new features
5. **Consider Impact**: Think about how changes affect the established architectural patterns

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Value types with automatic management
- **Network Optimized**: Debouncing and cancellation prevent unnecessary calls
- **Thread Safe**: MainActor isolation eliminates data races
- **Resource Clean**: Automatic cleanup through structured concurrency

## Future Considerations

The architecture supports several future enhancements:
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Region-based filtering
- Performance analytics integration
- Additional platform support

This documentation provides the foundation for understanding, maintaining, and extending MapKitSwiftSearch while preserving its design principles and architectural integrity.
