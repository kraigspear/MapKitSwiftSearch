## Major Bug Fix: Completer Continuation Conflicts (June 2025)

### Problem Identified

The original implementation used a shared `MKLocalSearchCompleter` instance and delegate handler across all search operations, which created several critical issues:

#### Original Problematic Code
```swift
// Problematic implementation (fixed)
public final class LocationSearch {
    // Shared instances - PROBLEM!
    private let localSearchCompleterHandler = LocalSearchCompleterHandler()
    private let searchCompleter = MKLocalSearchCompleter()
    
    init() {
        searchCompleter.delegate = localSearchCompleterHandler  // Set once
    }
    
    func search(queryFragment: String) async throws -> [LocalSearchCompletion] {
        // Multiple concurrent calls would conflict here
        return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            localSearchCompleterHandler.completionHandler = { result in
                // Which continuation should receive this result?
                continuation.resume(with: result)  // RACE CONDITION!
            }
            searchCompleter.queryFragment = queryFragment
        }
    }
}
```

#### Specific Issues

1. **Continuation Conflicts**: Multiple concurrent search calls would overwrite each other's completion handlers
2. **Result Misdirection**: Results from one search could be delivered to the wrong continuation
3. **Memory Leaks**: Unresumed continuations could accumulate in memory
4. **Race Conditions**: No mechanism to ensure continuation safety across concurrent operations

### Solution Implemented

The fix involved creating fresh `MKLocalSearchCompleter` and handler instances for each search operation:

#### Fixed Implementation
```swift
// Fixed implementation
@MainActor
private func performSearch(queryFragment: String) async throws -> [LocalSearchCompletion] {
    // Create fresh instances for each search - SOLUTION!
    let searchCompleter = MKLocalSearchCompleter()
    let localSearchCompleterHandler = LocalSearchCompleterHandler()
    searchCompleter.delegate = localSearchCompleterHandler
    
    return try await withTaskCancellationHandler {
        try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            // Safety flag to prevent double-resumption
            var hasResumed = false
            
            localSearchCompleterHandler.completionHandler = { result in
                guard !hasResumed else { return }  // SAFETY CHECK!
                hasResumed = true
                
                switch result {
                case let .success(completions):
                    continuation.resume(with: .success(completions))
                case let .failure(error):
                    continuation.resume(throwing: error)
                }
            }
            
            searchCompleter.queryFragment = queryFragment
        }
    } onCancel: {
        // Clean cancellation - RESOURCE CLEANUP!
        searchCompleter.cancel()
    }
}
```

### Why This Solution Works

#### 1. Complete Isolation
- **Per-Search Instances**: Each search operation gets its own completer and handler
- **No Shared State**: Eliminates all shared mutable state between concurrent operations  
- **Independent Lifecycle**: Each search manages its own resources independently

#### 2. Continuation Safety
- **hasResumed Guard**: Prevents accidental double-resumption of continuations
- **Single Handler**: Each continuation has exactly one dedicated completion handler
- **Clear Ownership**: No ambiguity about which continuation receives which results

#### 3. Proper Resource Management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Completers are automatically deallocated when searches complete
- **Cancellation Support**: Task cancellation properly cancels underlying MapKit operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: No accumulation of long-lived objects

#### 4. Structured Concurrency Integration
- **Task Cancellation Handler**: Integrates cleanly with Swift's cancellation system
- **Exception Safety**: Handles cancellation errors properly
- **Resource Scope**: Resources are scoped to specific task lifetimes

### Performance Impact

#### Before Fix (Problematic)
- **Memory Leaks**: Potentially unresumed continuations accumulating
- **Incorrect Results**: Search results delivered to wrong callers
- **Crash Risk**: Double-resumption could cause runtime failures

#### After Fix (Improved)
- **Memory Efficient**: Fresh instances prevent accumulation
- **Thread Safe**: No shared state between concurrent operations
- **Reliable**: Guaranteed correct result delivery
- **Fast Cancellation**: Immediate cleanup when operations are cancelled

## Platform Compatibility Update (June 2025)

### Changes Made

Updated minimum platform requirements to support newer concurrency features:

```swift
// Package.swift updates
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v26),    // Updated from .v18
    .macOS(.v26),  // Updated from .v15
]
```

### Rationale

1. **Concurrency Features**: Newer platforms provide better structured concurrency support
2. **MapKit Improvements**: Recent MapKit versions have better async/await integration
3. **Performance**: Newer runtime optimizations for Swift concurrency
4. **Future-Proofing**: Aligns with Apple's recommended deployment targets

## Strict Concurrency Enforcement (August 2025)

### Change Implemented

Added experimental StrictConcurrency feature to enhance compile-time safety:

```swift
// Package.swift
.target(
    name: "MapKitSwiftSearch",
    swiftSettings: [
        .enableExperimentalFeature("StrictConcurrency")
    ]
),
.testTarget(
    name: "MapKitSwiftSearchTests",
    dependencies: ["MapKitSwiftSearch"],
    swiftSettings: [
        .enableExperimentalFeature("StrictConcurrency")
    ]
)
```

### Benefits

1. **Compile-Time Safety**: Catches potential data races at compile time
2. **Sendable Validation**: Ensures proper Sendable conformance across actor boundaries
3. **Actor Isolation Checking**: Validates MainActor usage patterns
4. **Future Compatibility**: Prepares codebase for strict concurrency by default

### Impact on Codebase

#### Required @preconcurrency Import
```swift
// Added to handle MapKit's concurrency transition
@preconcurrency import MapKit
```

**Why Needed**: MapKit is still transitioning to full Sendable conformance, so `@preconcurrency` suppresses warnings while maintaining safety.

#### Verified Sendable Conformance
The strict concurrency checks validated that our public types are properly Sendable:
- `LocalSearchCompletion`: ✅ All properties are Sendable value types
- `Placemark`: ✅ All properties are Sendable value types  
- `HighlightRange`: ✅ All properties are Sendable value types
- `LocationSearch`: ✅ Properly isolated with @MainActor

## Highlight Range Bug Fix (Historical)

### Problem Identified

During code review, a bug was discovered in the platform-specific highlighting methods where `highlightedSubTitle` was incorrectly using `titleHighlightRange` instead of `subtitleHighlightRange`.

#### Buggy Code (Fixed)
```swift
// iOS and macOS implementations had this bug
func highlightedSubTitle(
    foregroundColor: PlatformColor = .lightGray,
    highlightColor: PlatformColor = .white
) -> AttributedString {
    highlightedText(from: subTitle,
                    highlightRange: titleHighlightRange,  // BUG! Wrong range
                    foregroundColor: foregroundColor,
                    highlightColor: highlightColor)
}
```

#### Fixed Implementation
```swift
// Corrected implementation
func highlightedSubTitle(
    foregroundColor: PlatformColor = .lightGray,
    highlightColor: PlatformColor = .white
) -> AttributedString {
    highlightedText(from: subTitle,
                    highlightRange: subtitleHighlightRange,  // FIXED! Correct range
                    foregroundColor: foregroundColor,
                    highlightColor: highlightColor)
}
```

### Test Coverage Added

A specific test was added to verify the fix and prevent regression:

```swift
@Test("Verify highlightedSubTitle uses correct highlight range")
func verifyHighlightedSubTitleUsesCorrectRange() throws {
    // Test verifies that highlightedSubTitle method uses subtitleHighlightRange
    // rather than titleHighlightRange, which was a bug found during code review
    
    let iosFilePath = "/.../LocalSearchCompletion+iOS.swift"
    let macOSFilePath = "/.../LocalSearchCompletion+macOS.swift"
    
    // Verify both platform implementations use correct range
    // Check line 27 contains "subtitleHighlightRange"
    // Ensure method context is correct
}
```

### Why This Test Approach

1. **Source Code Verification**: Directly validates the source code content
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catches copy-paste errors in platform implementations
3. **Build-Time Validation**: Fails at build time if bug is reintroduced
4. **Documentation**: Test name clearly describes what was fixed

## Code Organization Improvements

### Documentation Structure Enhancement

Recent improvements include organizing documentation into a clear hierarchy:

```
docs/
